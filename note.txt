****What is Data Structure****
Data Structure are different ways of organizing data on your computer, that can be used effectively.

****what is an Algorithm****
Algorithm in Computer Science: is a Set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a Task

****Types of Data Structure****

- Primitive Data Type: This are basic data type that can not be broken into smaller data type
 -integer
 -float
 -String
 -Boolean

 - Non Primitive Data Type: these are more complex data type that can be broken into smaller data type

###linear###: linear data structures are those in which the elements are arranged in a sequential order with each element connected to its adjacent elements.
These data structures are used to represent a sequence of data where the order of elements is important.
-List
-Tuple
-Array
-Linked List
-Stack
-Queue

###Non Linear Data Structures ###: These are those in which the elements are not arranged in a sequential order.  
These data structure are used to represent a hierarchical relationship between data elements where each elements is connect to one or more other elements in a specific way.
-Set
-Dictionary
-Tree
-Graph

Note:
List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary are built in data structures.


****Types of Algorithms****

- Sorting Algo: are used to store data in ascending or descending order.
- Searching Algo: are used to find a specific value in a data set.
- Graph Algo: are used to work with data that can be represented as a graph
- Dynamic Programming Algo: are used to solve problems by breaking them down tinto smaller sub-problems
- Divide and Conquer Algo: are used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems, solving each sub-problem independently, and then combining the results.
Recursive Algo: are used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems that are similar in nature
